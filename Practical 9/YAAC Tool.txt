YAAC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) is a software tool used in compiler design to generate syntax analyzers, also known as parsers. A parser is a program that reads the sequence of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and constructs a parse tree for the program.

The role of the parser is to recognize and interpret the structure of the program, according to the grammar rules of the programming language. This information is then used to generate the intermediate code, which is later translated into machine code for execution.

YAAC is used to generate the code for the parser based on a set of rules and patterns specified by the compiler designer. These rules and patterns, known as context-free grammars, define the syntax of the programming language and the structure of its non-terminal symbols.

YAAC works by generating a parser code that uses a parsing technique known as LALR (Look-Ahead Left-to-right Rightmost derivation). The generated code reads the sequence of tokens produced by the lexical analyzer and uses the LALR parsing algorithm to construct a parse tree for the program. When a syntax error is detected, the parser reports an error message to the user.

The use of YAAC in compiler design can greatly simplify the process of building a parser for a programming language. It allows the compiler designer to focus on the high-level structure and syntax of the language, while the details of parsing and error handling are handled automatically by the generated code.
